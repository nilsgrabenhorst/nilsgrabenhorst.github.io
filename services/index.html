My main focus is the Apple ecosystem: iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS. Feel free to <a href="mailto:nils.grabenhorst%40icloud.com?subject=App%20Development&body=Hi%20Nils,">contact me</a> if you need some help.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>I help build new teams and help developers grow. I support existing teams with deep knowledge of Swift, Objective-C, Frameworks, and Tools. I focus on safe, performant, and readable code. Maintainable code. Code that works.</p><p>Do you need support adopting new technologies like <strong>SwiftUI</strong> and <strong>strict Swift concurrency</strong>? <a href="mailto:nils.grabenhorst%40icloud.com?subject=App%20Development&body=Hi%20Nils,">Let's talk</a>!</p><h3>Architecture</h3><p>Well-structured code is the defining factor in the success of a project. It is not enough to pick any acronym from a catalogue of popular architectures<sup id=fnr1-2025-09-22><a href="#fn1-2025-09-22">1</a></sup> and call it a day. Instead, the design of an architecture should be carefully considered for each project. What are the most important goals? Does the project have unusually high security requirements<sup id=fnr2-2025-09-22><a href="#fn2-2025-09-22">2</a></sup>? Or is networking performance critical? How large and how advanced is the development team? Does the project domain have an inherent structure? Answers to these questions should shape the architecture of an app.</p><p>Adopting an architecture is only the first step. Even more important is a competent implementation. It needs to be clean, maintainable and well-documented.</p><h3>Design and UX Support</h3><p>Developers play an important role in the process of designing an app. Even the most experienced designers benefit from cooperating with a knowledgeable developer. I point out different and often lesser-known approaches to a design problem. I mention more modern APIs in the system frameworks that enable more elegant, streamlined and enjoyable designs. I help designers improve the accessibility of an app and give tips on how to make an app feel right at home on the operating system.</p><p>As an Architect, I have some design sensibilities and some design-adjacent training and experience. However, I know my place in a software team. Designers are just better at design. But I can give tips and provide alternative approaches that open up the design space. Designers can take my input, and do their amazing magic to create something wonderful.</p><h3>Server</h3><p>Did you know that technologies used to develop native apps can be used server-side, too? <a href="https://vapor.codes">Vapor</a> is a robust framework for building a server in Swift. Why should you consider server-side Swift?</p><ul><li>Share code between server and client<sup id=fnr3-2025-09-22><a href="#fn3-2025-09-22">3</a></sup></li><li>Use iOS developers as fullstack developers</li><li>Swift is safe, fast, and uses very little memory<sup id=fnr4-2025-09-22><a href="#fn4-2025-09-22">4</a></sup><sup id=fnr5-2025-09-22><a href="#fn5-2025-09-22">5</a></sup><sup id=fnr6-2025-09-22><a href="#fn6-2025-09-22">6</a></sup></li><li>Swift is very strict with types and optionality. No surprise missing fields in JSON payloads.</li><li>Swift is production-ready for server development</li></ul><p>A Swift server can be quickly set up as a mocking environment for app development before a real server becomes available. A Swift server can also be <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/server/guides/deployment.html">deployed</a> in production.</p><h3>Contact</h3><p>The best way to contact me is by <a href="mailto:nils.grabenhorst%40icloud.com?subject=App%20Development&body=Hi%20Nils,">email</a>.</p><div class="footnotes">

Popular architectures include _MVVM_, _VIPER_, and _TCA_

Banking apps and personal health apps are examples for elevated security requirements. A match-three-game may focus more on animation performance instead.

Swift compiles natively to many supported target platforms, including iPhones, Macs, Linux, Windows, and embedded systems with different processor architectures, including ARM and X86. Most important frameworks are available cross-platform, except for some Apple-specific frameworks (e.g. AppKit, UIKit, and SwiftUI).

<a href="https://tech.phlux.us/Juice-Sucking-Servers-Part-Trois/" target="_blank">Benchmark</a>: The utility of benchmarks may be debatable. This particular benchmark surfaced a few issues in the configuration and tooling of a Vapor server and lead to a very intensive debugging thread on the Swift forums. Wade Tregaskis wrote a long <a href="https://wadetregaskis.com/swift-sucks-at-web-serving-or-does-it/" target="_blank">article</a> about this experience. One issue on the Vapor framework was promptly <a href="https://github.com/vapor/vapor/releases/tag/4.96.0" target="_blank">patched</a> and with improved benchmark tooling the results are impressive: "Memory wise it blows all the other technologies away, using only 2.5% of the amount of memory that the java implementation needs, and 10% of node-js."
